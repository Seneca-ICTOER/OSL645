## What This Course is About

Unix and Linux represent the operating system technology powering many of the services we access every day - from Smart Phones, Cloud Computing and the Internet. Unix and Linux systems are often used to provide core services for companies as they are stable and secure. Updating is simple and does not usually require a system reboot unless the Kernel is updated. This subject introduces students to Unix and Linux.

Students will learn the core utilities to work productively in a Linux environment. Students will do this work using the shell on a Linux virtual machine. Students will learn to configure their login accounts, manipulate data stored in files, effectively use Linux commands and utilities, and write simple shell scripts.
